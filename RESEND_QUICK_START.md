# ðŸš€ Quick Resend Setup Guide

Based on your code snippet, here's how to get your email system working:

## 1. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up
2. In your dashboard, click "API Keys"
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Name it "Music Platform Production"
5. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

## 2. Update Your Environment

Replace `re_xxxxxxxxx` in your code with your actual API key by updating `.env.local`:

```bash
# Replace this line:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here

# With your actual key:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_from_resend_dashboard
```

## 3. Test Your Setup

I've created a comprehensive email testing page for you:

```bash
# Visit this URL (make sure your dev server is running):
http://localhost:3003/email-test
```

## 4. Quick Terminal Setup

You can also use the setup script I created:

```bash
node scripts/setup-resend.js
```

This will guide you through the configuration step by step.

## 5. What You'll Be Able to Send

âœ… **Welcome Emails** - For new fans and creators  
âœ… **Payment Confirmations** - For Stripe transactions  
âœ… **Subscription Notifications** - For new subscriptions  
âœ… **Creator Invites** - To grow your platform  
âœ… **Newsletters** - Keep users engaged  

## 6. Test Cards & Email Addresses

For testing, you can use:
- **Email**: Any email address you have access to
- **Stripe Test Cards**: `4242424242424242` (always succeeds)

## Your Code is Ready!

Your integration code looks perfect:

```javascript
import { Resend } from 'resend';
const resend = new Resend('re_your_actual_key_here');
resend.apiKeys.create({ name: 'Production' });
```

Just replace `'re_xxxxxxxxx'` with your real API key and you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰

**Next Steps:**
1. Get your API key from Resend
2. Update `.env.local` 
3. Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`)
4. Test at `http://localhost:3003/email-test`

Your music platform will then have beautiful, automated emails! ðŸ“§ðŸŽµ
